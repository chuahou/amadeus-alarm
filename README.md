# Amadeus Alarm

An unfaithful replication of the Amadeus app from the Steins;Gate 0 VN for
Android. Inspired by [this project](https://github.com/Yink/Amadeus), I
created this app to act as a simple alarm application with similar look
and feel without the actual talking Kurisu (especially useful when you want
a loud alarm but don't want to hear a loud "HELLO" early in the morning).

## Compilation

Just open it with Android Studio and let it do the work.

## Installation

Standard APK installation.

## Usage

When you open the app, click `CONNECT` to enter the settings page. Set the
alarm and turn on / off accordingly from the settings page. Press the back
button to exit.

When the alarm rings, click `CONNECT` to enter the Steins;Gate worldline
(and turn off the alarm). Otherwise, click `CANCEL` to get Kurisu
disappointed in you and snooze the alarm for ~2 mins.

## Warning

**NOTE**: Use this as your primary alarm at your own risk. Reliability has
not been tested.

## Planned features

- Vibration option
- Ringtone options other than default (Beginning of Fight)
- Customisation of snooze
- Other customisation and reliability changes
