# Amadeus Alarm

An unfaithful replication of the Amadeus app from the Steins;Gate 0 VN for
Android. Inspired by [this project](https://github.com/Yink/Amadeus), I
created this app to act as a simple alarm application with similar look
and feel without the actual talking Kurisu (especially useful when you want
a loud alarm but don't want to hear a loud "HELLO" early in the morning).
